# Interview Practice!
As I've been going through the job hunt, I've realized I need practice interviewing.  So I decided to take some initiative and wrote a python script to help me practice!  I wanted to create something short that I could practice everyday.  So I create a Flask app that would ask me two random questions (with a 60 second delay between them) and then I could start over if I wanted.

## Files Included in this Repo:
1.) Static folder that includes the style.css.  (<i>NOTE - </i>When using Flask, the style.css needs to be stored in a folder titled 'Static')
2.)
